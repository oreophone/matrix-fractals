# Matrix Fractals
Made in 2023 for the ANU Extension Mathematics program, the project consists of a
UI used for the creation of up to 6 matrices, and a renderer that generates a fractal
in real time based on these matrices. Each 2 â€¢ 2 matrix can be generated from one of four
*actions* (shear, dilate, rotate, scale), or edited directly. 

The project was written in Rust using the *iced* framework (0.8.0), on top of a handmade matrix
framework built with basic implementations and QOL features. Unfortunately, at the time of writing
the project has already aged enough to which it has resisted all attempts to run on my new hardware
(something about the *ab-glyph-rasterizer* library). Thus, I have chosen to leave this project
unfinished and untouched in its previously-working, warning-dense state. If you do get it to work or
have any suggestions, please reach out on my email!
